          <h1>Visual Studio</h1>
          <p>Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE). 
            It is developed by Microsoft to create Desktop applications, GUI (Graphical User Interface), console, web applications, mobile applications, cloud, and web services, ect. 
            You can use this to write codes like HTML, JavaScript, Python, CSS, ect. Visual Studio doesn't need money for you to use it.
            Visual Studio is a free application.</p> 
            <h1>Setting It Up</h1>
            <p>To get this awesome application to work, after downloading it, press on the file button up top and press "Open Folder...".
            Pick the folder you want to load in Visual Studio and press "Select Folder". If you already have your files downloaded into a folder, this makes it easier for you to open it. 
            If you don't have your files ready, you can make new ones. To do that you make an empty folder in the folders place, and open it in Visual Studio.
            Then you click on the "new file" icon near the place where the word "explorer" is found. By clicking on the icon, you can name the files you want to make.
            Ex: index.html, main.js, style.css, ect. The next step is typing your code into the computer language you chose. 
            For example, aftr creating a html file, you type html tags into enpty space on the right of the explorer side. 
            The same goes with other languages like JavaScript and CSS.</p>

            <p>Console Screen is mostly used as a debugging tool. 
                Whenever you open console, it shows you if you have any mistakes in your code. 
                It can also be used to show how the code functions.
                For example, if you choose JavaScript, and open the console page, you will see the funtions you used.
                Some function name are Concat function, Math max function, Square Root function, ect. 
                To open console, you right click on the tab and press the word "inspect". 
                Moving forward click on the console button on the top.

        var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log (full_name);
        var a = 9;
        var b = 4;
        var add = a + b ;
        console.log(add);
        var minus = a - b ;
        console.log(minus);
        var multiply = a * b;
        console.log(multiply);
        var divide = a / b;
        console.log(divide);
        var max = Math.max(4 , 5 , 0 , 9 , 13 , 16 , 10);
        console.log(max);
        var min = Math.min(4 , 5 , 0 , 9 , 13 , 16 , 10);
        console.log(min);
        var sqrt = Math.sqrt(26);
        console.log(sqrt);
        var number = sqrt.toFixed(2);
        console.log(number);
